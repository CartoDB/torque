### L.TorqueLayer

A layer to be added to a Leaflet map. It works as a regular tiled layer within the Leaflet tile pane, but instead of containing `<img>` elements, it's composed of a single [`<canvas>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API) where all markers are drawn.

**Example:**
```javascript
var torqueLayer = new L.TorqueLayer({
  user: 'viz2',
  table: 'ow',
  cartocss: '<cartocss here>'
});

map.addLayer(torqueLayer);
```
