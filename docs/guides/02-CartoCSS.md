## -torque-clear-color

## -torque-frame-count
Number of animation steps/frames used in the animation. If the data contains a fewer number of total frames, the lesser value will be used.

## -torque-resolution
Spatial resolution in pixels. A resolution of 1 means no spatial aggregation of the data. Any other resolution of N results in spatial aggregation into cells of NxN pixels. The value N must be power of 2.

## -torque-animation-duration
Animation duration in seconds.

## -torque-aggregation-function
A function used to calculate a value from the aggregate data for each cell. See [-torque-resolution](#-torque-resolution).

## -torque-time-attribute
The table column that contains the time information used create the animation.

## -torque-data-aggregation
A linear animation will discard previous values while a cumulative animation will accumulate them until it restarts.
